# MonR 

MonR is an on-going open-source backend that provides 
an interface for services that want to implement 
memorization techniques (flashcards) into their apps. 

By far, the best examples of clients using this API could be language learning games and educational software. 
I believe such calculations should be left to the backend, and that is why this project was born.
