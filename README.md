# MonR 

MonR is an on-going open-source backend that provides 
an interface for services that want to implement 
memorization techniques (flashcards) into their apps. 

By far, the best example of a client using this API could be language learning games. 
I believe such calculations should be left to the backend, and that is why this project was born.
